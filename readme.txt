JAR is in out/artifacts/CS4150FinalProject_jar/CS4150FinalProject.jar

Any scenario can be set up by clicking LMB and RMB to place melee and ranged enemies respectively. We recommend scenarios with just melee to test bullet dodging, just ranged to test their fleeing capabilities, and mixed to show off the effectiveness of the combined arms approach of the enemies. To reset the map press ‘r’

For player controls:
Movement: w, a, s, d (standard directions)
Shoot: f - shoots in the direction of the mouse

Gameplay is somewhat similar to Crypt of the NecroDancer in that every move the player makes means the enemies make a move too (but not in real time).

Using IntelliJ as a Java Development Client - so we can implement classes and models in Java and render using processing.
