TILE EFFECTS:
      In our game, the type of tile that the player of enemy is standing on will effect them. The 4 types of tiles in our game our sand, water, grass, and dirt. 2 of the tiles water and sand will have a negative effect on the player. In water, the player/enemy will be unable to fire their gun and while they are in sand they will move at 0.5X speed. While on grass and dirt, the tile will have a positive effect on the player. Grass will increase player movement speed by 2X and dirt will add damage to shots fired in that area. By having both positive and negative effects across the map, we will have to make sure our AI is accurately traversing the map with the most positive outcome.
