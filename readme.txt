Using IntelliJ as a Java client - so we can implement classes and models in Java and render using processing.

Upload content through git hub. 
When committing, put name at the beginning of the commit message.
Processing should treat each tab (.pde file) as a part of an overarching sketch. Make sure all necessary tabs are open at the same time.
Diverse file structure is nice!.
Check issues for stuff that needs to be done.
